This code is not effective anymore as the MUSCATE server for THEIA has been replaced by the [Geodes](https://geodes.cnes.fr/) server. GEODES now distributes all the Earth Observation produced by CNES, and also hosts the Copernicus COllaborative ground segment, that distributes Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 products. 

GEODES uses [the STAC API](https://geodes.cnes.fr/support/api/) but also provides a [Python API mamed PyGeodes](https://cnes.github.io/pyGeodes/index.html), already functional but still in development (as of february 2025).
